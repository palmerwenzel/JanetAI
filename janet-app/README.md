## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get the project running locally for development, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. You will also need to install the system dependencies required by Tauri, as outlined [here](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the application directory and install the Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    cd janet-app
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:** Once dependencies are installed, you can start the application in development mode.
    ```bash
    npm run tauri dev
    ```
    This will compile the Rust backend and the Svelte frontend, and launch the application. The window will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
